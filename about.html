  <h2>Alzheimer’s Disease:</h2>
<p>
Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the brain’s hippocampus area and entorhinal cortex: critical regions required for learning and memory. This disease is progressive in nature and ultimately lead to dementia. They also have unknown causes and there are no known cures. (McGleenon et al. 1999) About 36 million people have Alzheimer’s globally and 500,000 of these patients are Canadians. (Alzheimer Toronto, 2015) (Alzheimer’s Statistics).

  <h2 class="destination">What is Acetylcholine and How does it Relate to Neurodegenerative Disorders?</h2>
  <img src="img\about\pic1.jpg"/>
  <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter associated with many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. After ACh transfers messages between neurons, it is inactivated by the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE). Alzheimer’s disease is directly related to progressive depletion of ACh within the body, and therefore current medications treat the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disorder by inhibiting AChE. Phenolics are secondary plant metabolites which contain antioxidant properties and have been reported to have the ability to inhibit AChE (Szwajgier and Borowiec, 2012). Plant-based sources can be used as dietary supplements for preventive management of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. <br>A protocol known as Ellman’s Test was used on a variety of common plant-based foods for their ability to inhibit AChE. This protocol utilizes spectroscopy to identify specific values of inhibition using a concentrated extract. <br>Inhibition at 2mg/mL extract concentration (% inhibition +- standard deviation):

    <ul>
      <li>Mint = 98.75 +- 3.58</li>
      <li>Beet leaves = 69.10 +- 6.16</li>
      <li>Cilantro = 53.79 +- 0.99</li>
      <li>Radish leaves = 40.94 +- 7.45</li>
      <li>Spinach = 38.13 +- 13.01</li>
    </ul>
  <p>As shown, the brain foods have high percentages of inhibition and certain samples that have an inhibition percentage of over 50% such as Mint, Cilantro and beet leaves can be considered for candidates of drug development for preventive management of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
